Welcome to my webpage! I am a consulting associate at Charles River Associates. I earned my MPhil in Economics from the University of Oxford and BA in Applied Mathematics (with Data Science) and BA in Economics from UC Berkeley. I am interested in applied microeconomics, game theory, networks, labor and health economics and have previously worked on projects in flat taxation, healthcare inequality and pandemic-induced changes in patient attitudes through leveraging deep learning techniques. In my [MPhil thesis](http://gevorgii.github.io/files/MPhilThesis_Khandamiryan_Gevorg_.pdf) I study reputatoion effects in repeated games with learning, where I propose a new framework of imperfect monitoring of past plays - called geodesic learning based on shortest distance path between entrants in the network. In my [bachelor's thesis](http://gevorgii.github.io/files/Berkeley_Gevorg_Thesis.pdf) I explore flat tax policies through the lense of a new income tax progressivity index and its relationship with GINI coefficient. In a separate research project class, I co-authored [a paper on drinking habits](http://gevorgii.github.io/files/drinkingproject.pdf) across 20 regions of Italy implementing an instrumental variable analysis using an interesting instrument extracted with a text sentiment model.

I aim to do research in the intersection of my experiences (i.e. using machine learning and econometric tools, simulations and numerical methods in labor, health and behavioral economics to understand phenomena pertaining to healthcare inequality, labor outcome, wage and employment differences, human behavior and learning from neighbors) and simultaneously explore new fields and topics.

Welcome to my webpage! I am a consulting associate at Charles River Associates. I earned my MPhil in Economics from the University of Oxford and BA in Applied Mathematics (with Data Science) and BA in Economics from UC Berkeley. I am interested in applied microeconomics, game theory, networks, labor and health economics and have previously worked on projects in flat taxation, healthcare inequality and pandemic-induced changes in patient attitudes through leveraging deep learning techniques.

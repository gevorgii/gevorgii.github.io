Welcome to my webpage! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at UC Berkleey. I earned my MPhil in Economics from the University of Oxford and BA in Applied Mathematics (with Data Science) and BA in Economics from UC Berkeley. I am interested in microeconomic theory, networks, labor and behavioral economics.

In my [MPhil thesis](http://gevorgii.github.io/files/MPhilThesis_Khandamiryan_Gevorg_.pdf) I study reputation effects in repeated games with learning, where I propose a new framework of imperfect monitoring of past plays - called geodesic learning based on shortest distance path between entrants in the network. 

In my [bachelor's thesis](http://gevorgii.github.io/files/Berkeley_Gevorg_Thesis.pdf) I explore flat tax policies through the lense of a new income tax progressivity index and its relationship with GINI coefficient. In a separate research project class, I co-authored [a paper on drinking habits](http://gevorgii.github.io/files/drinkingproject.pdf) across 20 regions of Italy implementing an instrumental variable analysis using an interesting instrument extracted with a text sentiment model.
